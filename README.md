# Application Overview  

>Parker's Pet Sitting is a React application I created for my frontend capstone project for Nashville Software School. It is styled using vanilla CSS and React-Bootstrap, and uses a JSON-server backend.

>This application provides peace of mind for pet owners when they need to leave their pet in the care of others. Parker's Pet Sitting provides a premium pet sitting service for most types of pets, including spiders and rodents. Pet sitters specialize in the type of pet they care for, and many are qualified to provide advanced care and administer medications. 

# Features
